# Helpful Hints from Spencer (and Russ)

# Good Ideas for Setting Things Up
1. Use Django Rest Framework Python Package For Our project
    -We may be already doing this, but we were not sure

2. Don't commit files that are used for the build, such as files located in venv, env, or __pycache__
    -They're likely to create conflicts, and it's bad practice to include build or binary files

3. Going along with the "don't commit build files" idea, each person should make their own virtual env for the project
    -Don't commit your virtual environment!
    -Each machine may install their requirements differently, and we don't want conflicts

4. Helpful Commands Outside of the Virtual Env
    -To create the virtual environment: 
        "python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment>"
    -To enter virtual environment:  
        ". <name of venv>/bin/activate"

5. Helpful Commands While Inside the Virtual Env
    -To install requirements from the server while in the virtual environment:
        "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    -To run the server 
        "python manage.py runserver"
    -To make the migrations that will be applied to the server after making changes
        "python manage.py makemigrations "
    -To apply the migrations that were made using the makemigrations Commands
        "python manage.py migrate"
    -To dump data from the database and put it into a file called "datadump.json"
        "python manage.py dumpdata --indent 2 > datadump.json"
    
# High Level Ideas That May Clear Things Up
1. In the src/urls.py, we should add a line that includes the urls defined in our api folder
    -src/urls.py is the high level root location for the project, but it's NOT neccessarily
     where the urls for the client facing application should go
    -This is a convention we should follow for Django to work correctly

2. We should add a file called urls.py in the api folder, which will be 
   where client-facing url paths will go 
    -This is where we map certain urls to different views, and call .as_view() for different
     classes defined in views.py 		

3. Views.py is where much of the logic goes for serializing data from the models
    -We define different classes with names like DonationsView, which serialize
     data and make queryset
    -Each class defined in views.py generally has a subclass, which determines
     what methods and functions it inherits
        -Pay attention to which subclasses we use, as this will give us different functionality
         for different views 
    -Then in urls.py, use DonationsView.as_view() to use that class for a given url


Spencer and I talked for a long time at the JumboCode meeting about Django, this commit reflects many of the changes we talked about.

-We updated the .gitignore file to ignore files which shouldn't be included in our github repository, like pycache, venv, and env files or files included in those directories. These files should be ignored by git when adding files to future commits.

-We physically removed the virtual environment directory from the project, and other build files. Each team member should have their own virtual environment, and not commit it or push it to our repository (it's a recipe for conflicts and bugs). When Spencer and I made a new virtual environment on my computer and ran the appropriate commands, things worked normally and we didn't encounter issues.

-We talked at a high level and detailed level about how to set things up. I capture many of the important ideas in helpfulHints.txt, which should help us get some momentum again on the backend.
