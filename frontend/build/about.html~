<p1> Students are less inclined to buy brand new textbooks at their school bookstores because of ridiculously high and rising prices; however, students still need textbooks to succeed in their classes. The Textbook Exchange Network (TEN) offers a solution to reduce the burden of textbook costs. The purpose of TEN is to create a cheaper on-campus alternative where students can buy and sell their used textbooks. Books are exchanged in person during open office hours run by volunteers. Students can sell books at any price they choose and students can browse the available book selection. </p1>
